KIS: Software testing instant service for development on large open source software
================================

Abstract
--------------------------------
 While open source software of large and complex scope (such as Linux kernel) is developing fast with the help of distributed version control system (such as GIT), current distributed development status gives unprecedented difficulties and pressure to software testing. We present a preliminary study of instant automated software testing for Linux kernel as an instant service and design a prototype KIS. The goal of KIS is to check the building and running errors of Linux kernel in ** short time** (<1 hour) after every new commits from hundreds branches and thousands of kernel developers. Our insights into Linux kernel developer behaviors and attitudes towards software testing allow us to make KIS to provide **precise** bug reports, and to improve their usability and effectiveness **without any harassment**. Preliminary work suggests KIS is technically feasible to give timely assistant to Linux kernel developers in their daily work and reduce amassed difficulties from different kinds of bugs in Linux kernel development life.  

1.Introduction
--------------------------------
1.1 Old history of tesing, 

Doing automated testing in a cloud instead of on individual developers’
machines increases the available compute power by orders
of magnitude. In the past, faster CPUs enabled increased levels
of interactivity in development, such as quick compile-retry cycles.
Cloud-based computation, offering vast numbers of fast CPUs with
plenty of memory, could engender a similar transformation, with
TaaS becoming a seamless extension of a developer’s environment.
If automated testing techniques can be adapted to scale up on cloud
infrastructures, they can yield the order-of-magnitude lower bug
density and higher programmer productivity we seek.
